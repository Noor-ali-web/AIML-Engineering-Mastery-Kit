    "## **💡 When to Use Deep RL**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **✅ Use Deep RL When:**\n",
    "1. **High-dimensional state spaces** (images, sensor data)\n",
    "   - Atari: 84×84×4 pixels\n",
    "   - Robotics: 100+ joint angles, forces, torques\n",
    "   - Manufacturing: 500+ parameters (equipment status, WIP levels)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sequential decision-making** (multi-step optimization)\n",
    "   - Not one-shot prediction (use supervised learning)\n",
    "   - Long-term consequences matter\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interaction with environment** (online learning)\n",
    "   - Can simulate environment (manufacturing, games)\n",
    "   - Or safely explore real environment (robotics with safety constraints)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No labeled optimal actions** (trial-and-error needed)\n",
    "   - Supervised learning requires (state, optimal_action) pairs\n",
    "   - RL learns from rewards (no need for optimal labels)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **❌ Don't Use Deep RL When:**\n",
    "1. **Low-dimensional state spaces** (< 100 dimensions)\n",
    "   - Use tabular Q-learning or linear function approximation (faster, simpler)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Labeled data available** (supervised learning better)\n",
    "   - RL requires 10-100× more data than supervised learning\n",
    "   - If you have (state, action) labels → use imitation learning or supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exploration dangerous/expensive** (safety-critical)\n",
    "   - Medical treatment: Can't explore random treatments on patients\n",
    "   - Autonomous driving: Can't crash cars during training\n",
    "   - Use offline RL (learn from logged data) or model-based RL (learn in simulation)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Real-time constraints** (< 1ms inference)\n",
    "   - Neural networks slower than tabular lookup (1-10ms vs 0.01ms)\n",
    "   - Use model compression (quantization, pruning) or hybrid systems\n",

    "\n",
    "Deep RL is transforming industries with **$250M-$600M/year** potential across manufacturing, robotics, autonomous systems, energy, finance, and healthcare. Key success factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start with simulation** (safe, fast, cheap)\n",
    "2. **Design reward functions carefully** (avoid reward hacking)\n",
    "3. **Use proven algorithms** (PPO for default, DQN for discrete, SAC for continuous)\n",
    "4. **Iterate rapidly** (1000+ experiments before production)\n",
    "5. **Deploy gradually** (shadow mode → A/B testing → full rollout)\n",
    "6. **Monitor continuously** (online learning, detect distribution shift)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your competitive advantage:**\n",
    "- **Manufacturing:** $40M-$80M/year per fab (cycle time reduction)\n",
    "- **Robotics:** $20M-$50M/year (deployment time 10× faster)\n",
    "- **Autonomous systems:** $50M-$100M/year (10× fewer disengagements)\n",
