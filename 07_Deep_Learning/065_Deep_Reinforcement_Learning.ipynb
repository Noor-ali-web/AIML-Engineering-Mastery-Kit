    "\n",
    "#### **Pitfall 1: Insufficient Exploration**\n",
    "- **Symptom:** Agent converges to suboptimal policy early (local minimum)\n",
    "- **Solution:** \n",
    "  - Epsilon-greedy: Start \u03b5=1.0, decay to 0.01 over 100K-1M steps\n",
    "  - Entropy regularization: \u03b2=0.01 (PPO/A3C)\n",
    "  - Curiosity-driven exploration: Intrinsic rewards for novel states\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Pitfall 2: Reward Hacking**\n",
    "- **Symptom:** Agent exploits reward function (e.g., spins in circles for \"forward progress\")\n",
    "- **Solution:**\n",
    "  - Carefully design reward function (dense rewards + shaping)\n",
    "  - Add constraints (e.g., minimum velocity, maximum energy)\n",
    "  - Human-in-the-loop validation (watch agent behavior)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Pitfall 3: Catastrophic Forgetting**\n",

    "  - Real-world fine-tuning: Collect 1K-10K real transitions, continue training\n",
    "  - Use robust sensors: Vision + force/torque (more robust than joint encoders)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Pitfall 5: Sample Inefficiency**\n",
    "- **Symptom:** Training takes 100M+ steps, weeks of GPU time\n",
    "- **Solution:**\n",
    "  - Imitation learning pretraining: Bootstrap with 1K-10K demonstrations\n",
    "  - Model-based RL: Learn dynamics model, plan ahead (MBPO, Dreamer)\n",
    "  - GPU-accelerated simulators: Isaac Gym (10-50\u00d7 faster)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Pitfall 6: Hyperparameter Sensitivity**\n",
    "- **Symptom:** Small changes in learning rate, batch size \u2192 10\u00d7 worse performance\n",
    "- **Solution:**\n",
    "  - Use proven defaults: PPO (lr=3e-4, batch=2048, K=10, \u03b5=0.2)\n",
    "  - Grid search on small problem first\n",
    "  - Population-based training (PBT): Evolve hyperparameters during training\n",
