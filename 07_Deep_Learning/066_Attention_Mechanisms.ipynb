    "**Symptom:** Attention weights become one-hot ([1.0, 0.0, 0.0, ...]), gradients vanish  \n",
    "**Cause:** Dot products QK^T grow large for high d_k (e.g., 512)  \n",
    "**Solution:** Scale by \u221ad_k \u2192 softmax(QK^T / \u221ad_k)  \n",

    "\n",
    "After mastering this notebook, explore these cutting-edge attention variants:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Efficient Attention Mechanisms**\n",
    "**Motivation:** O(n\u00b2) complexity prohibitive for long sequences (10K+ tokens)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Longformer (Beltagy et al., 2020):**\n",
    "- Sparse attention: Local (sliding window) + global (selected tokens)\n",
    "- Complexity: O(n\u00b7w) where w = window size (e.g., 512)\n",
    "- Use cases: Long documents (LegalBERT, SciBERT), code understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linformer (Wang et al., 2020):**\n",
    "- Low-rank approximation: Project keys/values to k dimensions (k << n)\n",
    "- Complexity: O(n\u00b7k) where k = 256 (vs n = 10000)\n",
    "- Accuracy: Within 1% of full attention, 100\u00d7 faster\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021):**\n",
    "- Kernel-based attention: No explicit softmax\n",
    "- Complexity: O(n\u00b7d) (linear in n!)\n",
    "- Use cases: Protein sequences (100K+ tokens), music generation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Cross-Modal Attention**\n",

    "\n",
    "**CLIP (Radford et al., 2021):**\n",

    "- Few-shot learning: 4 examples \u2192 80% accuracy (vs 0-shot 50%)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Relative Position Encodings**\n",
    "**Motivation:** Absolute positions (1, 2, 3, ...) don't capture relative distances\n",
    "\n",
    "**T5, BERT variants:**\n",
    "- Relative positional bias: b_ij = f(|i - j|) added to attention scores\n",
    "- Benefits: Extrapolates better to longer sequences, captures \"nearness\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE, Su et al., 2021):**\n",
    "- Rotate query/key by position angle: Q' = R(pos) Q\n",
    "- Used in GPT-Neo, PaLM, LLaMA\n",
    "- Benefits: Encodes both absolute and relative positions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Flash Attention (Dao et al., 2022)**\n",
    "**Motivation:** Memory bottleneck (storing n\u00d7n attention matrix)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Innovation:**\n",
    "- Fuse attention operations: Never materialize full attention matrix\n",
    "- Complexity: Same O(n\u00b2\u00b7d), but 2-4\u00d7 faster in practice (memory bandwidth optimization)\n",
    "- Memory: O(n\u00b7d) vs O(n\u00b2) (10\u00d7 reduction for n=10000)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact:**\n",
    "- Training: 15% faster for GPT-3 (saves millions in compute)\n",
    "- Inference: 2\u00d7 faster for long contexts (2K+ tokens)\n",
    "- Adoption: Used in GPT-4, PaLM 2, LLaMA 2\n",
