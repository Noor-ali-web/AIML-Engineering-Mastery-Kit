    "### **🔑 Key Concepts Preview**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the techniques, here's the intuition behind model compression:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. The Redundancy Hypothesis**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Observation: Neural networks are OVER-PARAMETERIZED\n",
    "- ResNet-50: 25M parameters, but only 2-3M are \"essential\"\n",
    "- BERT-Base: 110M parameters, but 40M sufficient (DistilBERT)\n",
    "- GPT-3: 175B parameters, but 40B sufficient (compressed models)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Training dynamics: Over-parameterization helps optimization (wider basins)\n",
    "Deployment: Once trained, many parameters are redundant (can be removed)\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogy: Scaffolding for construction\n",
    "- Training: Need scaffolding (over-parameterization) to build\n",
    "- Deployment: Remove scaffolding (pruning), building stands\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Magnitude Pruning (Weight-Level)**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Intuition: Small weights contribute little to predictions\n",
    "weights = model.get_weights()  # Shape: (1000, 1000)\n",
    "threshold = np.percentile(np.abs(weights), 90)  # 90th percentile\n",
    "\n",
    "# Zero out smallest 90%\n",
    "mask = np.abs(weights) > threshold\n",
    "pruned_weights = weights * mask\n",
    "\n",
    "# Result: 90% sparsity (10% non-zero)\n",
    "# Accuracy: 95% → 94% (-1% only!)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Works:**\n",
    "- Weight distribution: Most weights are small (Gaussian-like)\n",
    "- Small weights: |w| < 0.01 → Contribute <1% to output\n",
    "- Pruning small weights: Negligible impact on predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Structured Pruning (Filter-Level)**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Intuition: Remove entire filters (not just weights)\n",
    "# Unstructured pruning: 90% sparsity → No speedup (irregular memory access)\n",
    "# Structured pruning: Remove 50% filters → 2× speedup (regular memory access)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Conv layer with 64 filters\n",
    "for filter_idx in range(64):\n",
    "    importance = compute_importance(filter_idx)  # L1 norm, Taylor expansion, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sort by importance, remove bottom 50%\n",
    "filters_to_keep = top_k(importance, k=32)\n",
    "pruned_layer = keep_filters(layer, filters_to_keep)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Result: 64 filters → 32 filters (50% reduction)\n",
    "# Speedup: 2× (fewer MACs), not just size reduction\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Knowledge Distillation (Model-Level)**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Intuition: Train small model to mimic large model\n",
    "teacher = BERT_Base(110M params)  # Pre-trained, 95% accuracy\n",
    "student = BERT_Small(40M params)  # Randomly initialized\n",
    "\n",
    "# Distillation loss: Match teacher's soft predictions (not just hard labels)\n",
    "for batch in train_loader:\n",
    "    # Teacher predictions (soft, with temperature)\n",
    "    teacher_logits = teacher(batch) / temperature  # Temperature = 2-5\n",
    "    teacher_probs = softmax(teacher_logits)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Student predictions\n",
    "    student_logits = student(batch) / temperature\n",
    "    student_probs = softmax(student_logits)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Distillation loss: KL divergence (match distributions)\n",
    "    loss_distill = KL_divergence(student_probs, teacher_probs)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Hard label loss: Cross-entropy (match ground truth)\n",
    "    loss_hard = cross_entropy(student_logits, labels)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Total loss: Weighted combination\n",
    "    loss = 0.9 * loss_distill + 0.1 * loss_hard\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Backprop\n",
    "    loss.backward()\n",
    "    optimizer.step()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Result: Student (40M) achieves 93% accuracy (vs teacher's 95%)\n",
    "# Compression: 110M → 40M (2.75× smaller)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Temperature Matters:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Without temperature (T=1):\n",
    "logits = [10, 2, 1]  # Teacher logits\n",
    "probs = softmax(logits) = [0.9999, 0.0001, 0.0000]  # Nearly one-hot\n",
    "\n",
    "# With temperature (T=5):\n",
    "logits_scaled = [10/5, 2/5, 1/5] = [2, 0.4, 0.2]\n",
    "probs = softmax(logits_scaled) = [0.70, 0.18, 0.12]  # Soft distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why soft is better:\n",
    "# - Encodes relative similarities: Class 2 is \"closer\" to class 0 than class 3\n",
    "# - Student learns richer knowledge: Not just \"answer is 0\", but \"0 is most likely, 1 is somewhat likely, 2 is unlikely\"\n",
    "# - Better generalization: Soft targets act as regularization\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Quantization (Precision Reduction)**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Intuition: Reduce numerical precision (FP32 → INT8)\n",
    "# FP32: 32 bits per weight, range [-3.4e38, 3.4e38]\n",

    "## Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Pitfall 1: One-Shot Pruning\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Bad: Prune 90% at once\n",
    "prune_90_percent(model)\n",
    "fine_tune(model, epochs=5)  # Hard to recover\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix**: Iterative pruning (gradual compression)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Good: Gradual pruning\n",
    "for sparsity in [0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.85, 0.9]:\n",
    "    prune_to_sparsity(model, sparsity)\n",
    "    fine_tune(model, epochs=2)  # Easier to recover\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Pitfall 2: No Hardware Support\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Bad: Quantize to INT8 but run on CPU without VNNI\n",
    "model_int8 = quantize(model)\n",
    "# Result: Slower than FP32! (INT8 dequantized to FP32)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix**: Verify hardware support\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Good: Check for INT8 support\n",
    "if torch.backends.quantized.engine == 'fbgemm':  # x86 VNNI\n",
    "    model_int8 = quantize(model)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"No INT8 support, use FP32\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Pitfall 3: Pruning After Quantization\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Bad: Quantize then prune (quantization loses sparsity)\n",
    "model_int8 = quantize(model)\n",
    "prune(model_int8)  # No effect! INT8 can't represent exact zeros\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix**: Prune first, then quantize\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Good: Prune → Fine-tune → Quantize\n",
    "prune(model)\n",
    "fine_tune(model)\n",
    "quantize(model)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 1. Iterative Compression\n",
    "- Start conservative (50% sparsity), gradually increase\n",
    "- Fine-tune after each pruning step (2-5 epochs)\n",
    "- Monitor accuracy drop (<1% acceptable, >3% investigate)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 2. Per-Channel Quantization\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Better: Per-channel scale (separate per filter)\n",
    "for i in range(num_channels):\n",
    "    scale[i] = max(abs(weights[i])) / 127\n",
    "    weights_int8[i] = round(weights[i] / scale[i])\n",
    "\n",
    "# vs Global scale (single for all filters)\n",
    "scale = max(abs(weights)) / 127  # Suboptimal\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why**: Different channels have different ranges (e.g., [−0.1, 0.1] vs [−5, 5])\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 3. Calibration Data for PTQ\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Use representative data (not random)\n",
    "calibration_data = train_data.sample(1000)  # Not val_data!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Cover diverse scenarios\n",
    "calibration_data = [\n",
    "    indoor_images,   # Different lighting\n",
    "    outdoor_images,  # Different ranges\n",
    "    night_images     # Edge cases\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 4. Validate on Target Device\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Don't trust simulation\n",
    "latency_sim = 45ms  # Simulated\n",
    "\n",
    "# Measure on real device\n",
    "with torch.no_grad():\n",
    "    for _ in range(100):\n",
    "        start = time.time()\n",
    "        output = model(input.to('cuda'))\n",
    "        torch.cuda.synchronize()  # Critical!\n",
    "        latency = (time.time() - start) * 1000\n",
    "\n",
    "# latency_real = 58ms (30% higher due to memory bandwidth)\n",
