    "- Shallow models (SVM, Random Forest on engineered features)\n",
    "- **ImageNet accuracy:** ~75% (2011 winner)\n",

    "- Deep hierarchical representations\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Why CNNs Work for Images**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional fully-connected networks fail for images:**\n",
    "- **Too many parameters:** 224×224×3 image = 150K pixels → 150K×1000 = 150M weights for first layer alone!\n",
    "- **No spatial structure:** Treats pixels as independent features (ignores proximity)\n",
    "- **Not translation invariant:** Cat in top-left ≠ cat in bottom-right (must learn separately)\n",
    "\n",
    "**CNNs solve these problems:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Parameter sharing:** Same filter applied to entire image (1K parameters vs 150M)\n",
    "- ✅ **Spatial locality:** Convolutions preserve 2D structure (nearby pixels processed together)\n",
    "- ✅ **Translation invariance:** Same filter detects features anywhere in image\n",
    "- ✅ **Hierarchical features:** Low-level edges → mid-level textures → high-level objects\n",

    "2. **Computational Cost**\n",
    "   - For each output pixel: $k_h \\times k_w$ multiplications\n",
    "   - Total operations: $(n-k+1)^2 \\times k^2$ for $n \\times n$ input, $k \\times k$ filter\n",

    "   - ✅ GPU acceleration (100-1000× faster)\n",
    "   - ✅ Optimized implementations (cuDNN, MKL)\n",

    "\n",
    "### **CNN Architecture Design Principles**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start simple, go deep gradually**\n",
    "   - Begin with 3-5 conv layers (like VGG)\n",
    "   - Add residual connections if >10 layers (like ResNet)\n",
    "   - Use batch normalization after every conv layer\n",

    "3. **Parameter efficiency**\n",
    "   - 1×1 convolutions reduce channels (dimensionality reduction)\n",

    "   - Global Average Pooling replaces FC layers (fewer parameters, regularization)\n",

    "4. **Modern best practices**\n",
    "   - ReLU activation (or variants: LeakyReLU, ELU, Swish)\n",

    "### **Transfer Learning Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use transfer learning:**\n",
    "- ✅ Limited data (<10K samples)\n",
    "- ✅ Similar domain (natural images, medical images, wafer maps all benefit from ImageNet features)\n",
    "- ✅ Time/compute constraints (10× faster training)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best practices:**\n",
    "1. **Start with feature extraction:** Freeze all layers except final classifier\n",
    "2. **Fine-tune gradually:** After feature extraction converges, unfreeze last few layers\n",
    "3. **Lower learning rate for fine-tuning:** Use 10-100× smaller LR for pre-trained layers\n",
    "4. **Data augmentation:** More aggressive augmentation for small datasets\n",
    "5. **Choose appropriate backbone:** ResNet-50 (balanced), EfficientNet (efficient), VGG (simple)\n",
    "\n",
    "**When NOT to use transfer learning:**\n",
    "- ❌ Very different domain (satellite imagery, medical histology)\n",
    "- ❌ Massive dataset (>1M samples, train from scratch can be better)\n",
    "- ❌ Real-time constraints (pre-trained models often large, use MobileNet instead)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Production Deployment Checklist**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Model optimization:** ONNX export, INT8 quantization (4× faster inference)\n",
    "- ✅ **Batch inference:** Process multiple images at once (10× throughput increase)\n",
    "- ✅ **GPU acceleration:** Use ONNX Runtime with GPU provider (<10ms inference)\n",
    "- ✅ **Monitoring:** Log predictions, latency, errors (detect model drift)\n",
    "- ✅ **Explainability:** Grad-CAM or LIME to visualize decisions (engineer trust)\n",
    "- ✅ **A/B testing:** Compare new model vs baseline before full rollout\n",
    "- ✅ **Fallback:** Simple rule-based system if model fails\n",
    "- ✅ **Retraining pipeline:** Automate monthly retraining as new data arrives\n",

    "### **Semiconductor-Specific Best Practices**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data augmentation for wafer maps:**\n",
    "   - Rotation (0-360°, wafers can be oriented any way)\n",
    "   - Flip (horizontal, vertical)\n",
    "   - Zoom (simulate different die sizes)\n",
    "   - **Don't use:** Color jittering (wafer maps are binary pass/fail)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handle class imbalance:**\n",
    "   - Most wafers are normal (80%+), defects rare (<20%)\n",
    "   - Use focal loss, class weights, or SMOTE oversampling\n",
    "   - Prioritize recall for rare critical defects\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Spatial correlation matters:**\n",
    "   - CNN captures neighboring die failures (cluster patterns)\n",
    "   - Combine with parametric test data (hybrid CNN + MLP)\n",
    "   - Use attention mechanisms to focus on defect regions\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Explainability is critical:**\n",
    "   - Engineers need to understand why model classified wafer\n",
    "   - Use Grad-CAM to highlight defect regions\n",
    "   - Build trust through interpretability\n",
