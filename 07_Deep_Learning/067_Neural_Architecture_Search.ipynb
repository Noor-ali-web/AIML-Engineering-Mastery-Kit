    "### **🔑 Key Concepts Preview**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the algorithms, here's the intuition behind NAS:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. The NAS Problem (Three Components)**\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Search Space: What architectures can we explore?\n",
    "   - Operations: conv3x3, conv5x5, max_pool, attention, residual\n",
    "   - Connections: How layers connect (skip connections, dense, etc.)\n",
    "   - Hyperparameters: Depth, width, kernel sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Search Strategy: How do we navigate the search space?\n",
    "   - Reinforcement Learning: Controller RNN learns to generate good architectures\n",
    "   - Evolutionary: Mutate + crossover architectures, select fittest\n",
    "   - Gradient-Based: Optimize architecture via backpropagation (DARTS)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Evaluation Strategy: How do we measure architecture quality?\n",
    "   - Train from scratch: Accurate but slow (days per architecture)\n",
    "   - Weight sharing: Fast but biased (minutes per architecture)\n",
    "   - Early stopping: Compromise (hours per architecture)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Search Space Example (MobileNet-like)**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "search_space = {\n",
    "    'num_layers': 7,  # Fixed depth\n",
    "    'layer_i_operation': ['conv3x3', 'conv5x5', 'conv7x7', 'max_pool3x3', 'avg_pool3x3', 'identity'],\n",
    "    'layer_i_channels': [16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128],\n",
    "    'layer_i_kernel_size': [3, 5, 7],\n",
    "    'layer_i_stride': [1, 2]\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Total architectures: 6^7 × 7^7 × 3^7 × 2^7 ≈ 10^14 (100 trillion!)\n",
    "# Exploration challenge: Can't try all, need smart search strategy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. NASNet Architecture (Discovered by RL-NAS)**\n",
    "```\n",
    "NASNet-A Cell (Discovered, not hand-designed):\n",
    "1. Input1 → SeparableConv5x5 → Identity → Add\n",
    "2. Input2 → SeparableConv3x3 → DepthwiseConv3x3 → Add\n",
    "3. Result1 + Result2 → Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it's good:\n",
    "- Depthwise separable convolutions: 8-9× fewer parameters than standard conv\n",
    "- Multiple paths: Ensemble effect (like multi-head attention)\n",
    "- Skip connections: Gradient flow (like ResNet)\n",
    "\n",
    "Human intuition: Would NOT have designed this specific combination\n",
    "NAS discovered: Through 20,000 architecture trials\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. DARTS Key Innovation (Continuous Relaxation)**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Discrete (original):\n",
    "  operation = one_of(['conv3x3', 'conv5x5', 'max_pool'])  # Discrete choice\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous (DARTS):\n",
    "  output = α1 × conv3x3(x) + α2 × conv5x5(x) + α3 × max_pool(x)\n",
    "  where α = softmax([α1, α2, α3])  # Continuous weights\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefit:\n",
    "- Can compute gradient: ∂Loss/∂α (optimize via backprop!)\n",
    "- Fast search: 1 GPU-day (vs 22,400 GPU-days for discrete RL-NAS)\n",

    "- Too narrow (10^2 architectures): Miss optimal\n",
    "- Sweet spot: Cell-based (10^6), discoverable + transferable\n",

    "- **Cause:** Weight sharing bias (ENAS), early stopping noise (NASNet)\n",
    "- **Solution:** Use multiple evaluation strategies (weight sharing + early stopping + train from scratch for top-10)\n",

    "**2. Overfitting to Validation Set**\n",
    "- **Problem:** Architecture optimized for validation set, poor test accuracy\n",
    "- **Cause:** Search uses validation set for architecture updates (data leakage)\n",
    "- **Solution:** Use separate search validation set + final test set (never seen during search)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Expensive Search Space**\n",
    "- **Problem:** 10^50 architectures, intractable to search\n",

    "- **Problem:** Discovered architecture has 200ms latency (vs <50ms target)\n",

    "- **Problem:** Architecture discovered on CIFAR-10 fails on ImageNet\n",
