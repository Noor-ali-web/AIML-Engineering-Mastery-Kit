    "**Federated Learning** is a distributed machine learning paradigm where **training occurs on decentralized edge devices** (smartphones, hospitals, factories) **without sharing raw data**. Instead of centralizing data in a single server, the model travels to the data, learns locally, and only shares model updates (gradients/weights).",
