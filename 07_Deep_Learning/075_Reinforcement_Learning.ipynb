    "\n",
    "A **Markov Decision Process** is a 5-tuple: **MDP = (S, A, P, R, \u03b3)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State Space (S)**: Set of all possible states\n",
    "   - Discrete: S = {s\u2081, s\u2082, ..., s\u2099}\n",
    "   - Continuous: S \u2286 \u211d\u207f\n",

    "   - Continuous: A \u2286 \u211d\u1d50\n",

    "3. **Transition Probability (P)**: P(s'|s, a)\n",
    "   - Probability of reaching state s' after taking action a in state s\n",

    "4. **Reward Function (R)**: R(s, a, s') or R(s, a) or R(s)\n",
    "   - Immediate reward for transition\n",
