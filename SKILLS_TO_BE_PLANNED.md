## 🎯 Recommended Action Plan for These Skills

### **Immediate Priority (Do Next)**
1. **Post-Silicon Validation Concepts** - Can create a theoretical notebook (182) covering ML applications
2. **Java Fundamentals** - Consider creating separate 200-series notebooks for Java if critical
3. **Shell Scripting** - Include practical examples in notebooks where possible

### **Employer-Sponsored Training**
- Silicon debug tools (ITP, DCI, XDP)
- ATE programming and operation
- Company-specific MES systems
- Proprietary EDA tool training

### **Online Certification Paths**
- Tableau & Power BI (if needed for reporting roles)
- AWS/Azure/GCP certifications (covered in notebooks 141-142)
- Six Sigma Green Belt / Black Belt

### **Hardware Lab Experience**
- JTAG debugging
- Oscilloscope and logic analyzer operation
- Test fixture development
- Environmental testing

### **Lower Priority / As Needed**
- VBA (only if maintaining legacy Excel systems)
- PCB CAD tools
- Specific vendor tools as job requires

## 📝 Notes on Partial Coverage

Some skills ARE partially covered in notebooks but need supplementation:

| Skill | Notebook Coverage | Additional Practice Needed |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Shell Scripting** | Basic commands in various notebooks | Create actual shell scripts, cron jobs, system automation |
| **Git/Version Control** | Covered in MLOps notebooks | Real repository management, branch strategies, PR reviews |
| **Linux System Admin** | Commands shown throughout | Full system administration, user management, security |
| **Docker/Kubernetes** | Notebooks 131-138 cover concepts | Deploy real applications, troubleshoot production issues |
| **Cloud Platforms** | Notebooks 141-143 cover APIs | Console navigation, cost optimization, multi-service architectures |
| **SQL** | Notebook 005 covers queries | Database administration, backup/recovery, replication |
