    "## Part 1: Scalability & Load Balancing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📈 What is Scalability?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalability** = System's ability to handle increased load by adding resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two Approaches:**\n",
    "1. **Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)**: Bigger servers (more CPU, RAM, disk)\n",
    "   - ✅ Simple (no code changes)\n",
    "   - ❌ Limited by hardware (max 1TB RAM, 128 cores)\n",
    "   - ❌ Single point of failure\n",
    "   - ❌ Expensive (non-linear cost curve)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)**: More servers\n",
    "   - ✅ Unlimited scaling (add 1000s of servers)\n",
    "   - ✅ Better fault tolerance (one server fails → others continue)\n",
    "   - ✅ Cost-effective (commodity hardware)\n",
    "   - ❌ Complex (distributed system challenges)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚖️ What is Load Balancing?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Load Balancer** = Distributes traffic across multiple servers to:\n",
    "- Maximize throughput\n",
    "- Minimize response time\n",
    "- Avoid overload on single server\n",
    "- Enable horizontal scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Load Balancing Algorithms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Algorithm | How It Works | Use Case |\n",
    "|-----------|--------------|----------|\n",
    "| **Round Robin** | Rotate through servers sequentially | Equal server capacity, stateless |\n",
    "| **Least Connections** | Send to server with fewest active connections | Varying request duration |\n",
    "| **IP Hash** | Hash client IP → same server | Session persistence needed |\n",
    "| **Weighted Round Robin** | Distribute based on server capacity | Mixed server sizes |\n",
    "| **Least Response Time** | Send to fastest responding server | Optimize latency |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Health Checks:**\n",
    "- Periodic pings to check server status\n",
    "- Remove unhealthy servers from pool\n",
    "- Add back when recovered\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🗄️ Caching Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cache** = Fast storage layer to reduce database load and latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cache Patterns:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Read:\n",
    "1. Check cache → Hit? Return data\n",
    "2. Cache miss → Query DB → Store in cache → Return\n",
    "\n",
    "Write:\n",
    "1. Write to DB\n",
    "2. Invalidate cache (or update)\n",
    "```\n",
    "✅ Good for read-heavy workloads\n",
    "❌ Cache miss penalty (DB query)\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Write-Through:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Write:\n",
    "1. Write to cache\n",
    "2. Write to DB synchronously\n",
    "3. Return success\n",
    "```\n",
    "✅ Data always consistent\n",
    "❌ Higher write latency (2 operations)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Write-Behind (Write-Back):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Write:\n",
    "1. Write to cache → Return immediately\n",
    "2. Asynchronously write to DB (batched)\n",
    "```\n",
    "✅ Low write latency\n",
    "❌ Risk of data loss if cache crashes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cache Eviction Policies:**\n",
    "- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Remove oldest accessed items\n",
    "- **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**: Remove least accessed items\n",
    "- **FIFO (First In First Out)**: Remove oldest items\n",
    "- **TTL (Time To Live)**: Items expire after X seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏭 Post-Silicon Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intel Test Data Query Caching:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Before (no cache):\n",
    "- Query: \"Get yield for wafer W001\" → 15s (scan 50M records)\n",
    "- 1000 queries/min → 250 concurrent DB connections → DB crash\n",
    "\n",
    "After (Redis cache, TTL=5min):\n",
    "- First query: 15s (cache miss, query DB, store in cache)\n",
    "- Subsequent queries: 5ms (cache hit) → 3000× faster\n",
    "- 1000 queries/min → 950 cache hits → 50 DB queries → DB stable\n",
    "\n",
    "Result: 99% cache hit rate, <10ms P95 latency, $5M DB cost savings\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**NVIDIA Model Inference Cache:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Scenario: Predict yield for same device multiple times\n",
    "- Model inference: 100ms\n",
    "- Cached result: 1ms (100× faster)\n",
    "- Cache key: hash(device_features)\n",
    "- TTL: 1 hour (predictions valid for 1 hour)\n",
    "\n",
    "Architecture:\n",
    "Client → Load Balancer → API Server → Check Redis → Cache hit? Return\n",

    "\n",
    "Result: 80% cache hit rate, 20ms avg latency (vs 100ms), serve 10× more requests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**AMD Load Balancing:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Before (single server):\n",
    "- 1 server, 16 cores, 64GB RAM\n",
    "- Max: 100 requests/sec\n",
    "- Peak traffic: 500 requests/sec → 400 timeout/fail\n",
    "\n",
    "After (horizontal scaling + load balancer):\n",
    "- 10 servers, 16 cores each, 64GB RAM each\n",
    "- Load balancer: NGINX (round-robin)\n",
    "- Each server: 100 requests/sec\n",
    "- Total capacity: 1000 requests/sec\n",
    "- Peak traffic: 500 requests/sec → 50 requests/server → All succeed\n",

    "### 📝 What's Happening in This Code?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Simulate load balancing, caching, and horizontal scaling for high-traffic systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- **Load Balancer**: Implements Round Robin, Least Connections, IP Hash algorithms to distribute requests\n",
    "- **Cache (LRU)**: Stores query results with TTL, evicts least recently used items when full\n",
    "- **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple servers handle requests in parallel, capacity scales linearly\n",
    "- **Health Checks**: Monitors server status, removes unhealthy servers, auto-recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:** Intel's test data platform uses Redis caching with 5-minute TTL, achieving 99% cache hit rate and reducing query latency from 15s → 5ms (3000× faster). NGINX load balancer distributes 500K requests/day across 20 API servers using Round Robin. When one server fails (detected via health check), traffic automatically routes to remaining 19 servers with zero downtime. This architecture saved $5M in database costs and handles 10× traffic growth without adding database capacity."

    "### 🌐 CAP Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "**CAP Theorem** (Brewer's Theorem): In distributed system, you can only guarantee 2 of 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **C** (Consistency): All nodes see same data at same time\n",
    "- **A** (Availability): Every request gets response (success/failure)\n",
    "- **P** (Partition Tolerance): System continues despite network failures\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trade-offs:**\n",
    "- **CP System** (Consistency + Partition Tolerance): Sacrifice availability\n",
    "  - Example: Banking systems, MongoDB (strong consistency mode)\n",
    "  - Use when: Data accuracy critical (financial transactions)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AP System** (Availability + Partition Tolerance): Sacrifice consistency\n",
    "  - Example: DNS, Cassandra, DynamoDB\n",
    "  - Use when: System must always respond (social media feeds)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CA System** (Consistency + Availability): Not partition tolerant\n",
    "  - Example: Traditional RDBMS (single node)\n",
    "  - Reality: Network partitions inevitable, CA doesn't exist in distributed systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🗄️ Database Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Replication** - Multiple copies of data\n",
    "- **Primary-Replica** (Master-Slave): Writes to primary, reads from replicas\n",
    "  - ✅ Read scalability (add more replicas)\n",
    "  - ❌ Write bottleneck (single primary)\n",
    "  - ❌ Replication lag (replicas may be stale)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-Primary**: Multiple nodes accept writes\n",
    "  - ✅ Write scalability, better availability\n",
    "  - ❌ Conflict resolution needed\n",
    "  - ❌ Complex to implement\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Sharding** - Partition data across multiple databases\n",
    "- **Horizontal Sharding**: Split rows (e.g., users 1-1M on DB1, 1M-2M on DB2)\n",
    "  - Shard key selection critical (user_id, device_id, geographic region)\n",
    "  - ✅ Unlimited horizontal scaling\n",
    "  - ❌ Joins across shards expensive\n",
    "  - ❌ Rebalancing shards complex\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vertical Sharding**: Split columns (e.g., user profile on DB1, user posts on DB2)\n",
    "  - ✅ Optimize per-domain workload\n",
    "  - ❌ Limited scaling (bounded by tables)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Denormalization** - Duplicate data for read performance\n",
    "- Trade storage for speed\n",
    "- Pre-compute joins, aggregations\n",
    "- Example: Store `user_name` in posts table (avoid join with users table)\n",

    "### 🎯 Microservices Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "**Microservices** = Small, independent services communicating via APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- ✅ Independent scaling (scale high-traffic services)\n",
    "- ✅ Technology diversity (different languages per service)\n",
    "- ✅ Fault isolation (one service fails → others continue)\n",
    "- ✅ Faster deployments (deploy services independently)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges:**\n",
    "- ❌ Distributed system complexity\n",
    "- ❌ Network latency between services\n",
    "- ❌ Data consistency across services\n",
    "- ❌ Debugging difficulty (trace requests across services)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Patterns:**\n",
    "- **API Gateway**: Single entry point, routing, authentication\n",
    "- **Service Discovery**: Services register/discover each other (Consul, etcd)\n",
    "- **Circuit Breaker**: Stop calling failing service, fail fast\n",
    "- **Event Sourcing**: Store events, rebuild state from event log\n",
