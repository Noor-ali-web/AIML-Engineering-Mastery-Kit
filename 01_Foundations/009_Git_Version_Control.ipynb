    "## 📚 What is Git & Version Control?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version control** is a system that records changes to files over time, enabling you to recall specific versions, collaborate effectively, and maintain code quality. **Git** is the de facto standard distributed version control system used by 95% of software teams worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Git for AI/ML?**\n",
    "- ✅ **Collaboration**: 10-100 engineers working on same codebase (Intel: 250+ engineers on AI platform)\n",
    "- ✅ **Reproducibility**: Track exact code version that trained a model (NVIDIA: \"Which commit produced model v2.3?\")\n",
    "- ✅ **Experimentation**: Branch for experiments without breaking production (AMD: 50+ feature branches active)\n",
    "- ✅ **Code Review**: Pull requests ensure quality before merge (Qualcomm: 98% bugs caught in review)\n",
    "- ✅ **Rollback**: Instantly revert bad deployments (Meta: rollback in <5 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version Control != Just Git:**\n",
    "- **Code**: Git tracks `.py`, `.ipynb`, config files\n",
    "- **Data**: DVC (Data Version Control) tracks datasets, models (>100MB files)\n",
    "- **Experiments**: MLflow tracks hyperparameters, metrics, artifacts\n",
    "- **Models**: Model registry (MLflow, SageMaker) tracks production models\n",

    "- `main`: Production-ready code (always deployable)\n",
    "- `develop`: Integration branch (active development)\n",
    "- `feature/*`: New features (branch from develop)\n",
    "- `release/*`: Release preparation (branch from develop)\n",
    "- `hotfix/*`: Emergency fixes (branch from main)\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use:**\n",
    "- ✅ Scheduled releases (quarterly, monthly)\n",
    "- ✅ Multiple versions in production\n",
    "- ✅ Large teams (50+ engineers)\n",
    "- ✅ High stability requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intel Example:**\n",
    "- 250 engineers, 20 products\n",
    "- `main`: Released silicon test programs\n",
    "- `develop`: Next-generation features\n",
    "- `feature/ddr5-test`: New DDR5 memory tests\n",
    "- `release/2024.Q1`: Stabilize for Q1 release\n",
    "- `hotfix/critical-bug`: Fix production issue\n",
    "- **Result**: 95% fewer production bugs, clear release process\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Trunk-Based Development** (Fast-Moving Teams)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure:**\n",
    "- `main`: Single source of truth (always deployable)\n",
    "- Short-lived feature branches (<2 days)\n",
    "- Feature flags for incomplete features\n",
    "- Continuous integration + daily commits\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use:**\n",
    "- ✅ Continuous deployment (10+ deploys/day)\n",
    "- ✅ Small teams (5-15 engineers)\n",

    "- Automated tests run on every commit\n",
    "- **Result**: 3× development velocity, zero merge conflicts\n",

    "#### 3. **GitHub Flow** (Simple Projects)\n",

    "**Structure:**\n",

    "- ❌ Harder to understand timeline\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rebase:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout feature\n",
    "git rebase main\n",
    "# Replays commits on top of main\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- ❌ Rewrites history (dangerous if shared)\n",
    "- ❌ Conflicts must be resolved per commit\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practice:**\n",
    "- **Rebase**: Private feature branches (clean up before PR)\n",
    "- **Merge**: Public branches (preserve collaboration history)\n",
