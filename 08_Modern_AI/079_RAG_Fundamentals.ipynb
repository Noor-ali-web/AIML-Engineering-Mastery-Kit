    "## **Why Retrieval-Augmented Generation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The LLM Knowledge Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before RAG:**\n",
    "- ❌ LLMs only know information from training data (static, outdated)\n",
    "- ❌ Cannot access private/proprietary documents\n",
    "- ❌ Hallucinate when uncertain (generate plausible but incorrect information)\n",
    "- ❌ Cannot cite sources (no transparency)\n",
    "\n",
    "**After RAG:**\n",
    "- ✅ Access current and private information dynamically\n",
    "- ✅ Ground responses in retrieved factual documents\n",
    "- ✅ Cite sources for transparency and verification\n",
    "- ✅ More cost-effective than fine-tuning for knowledge updates\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Hallucination Crisis**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example hallucination scenarios:**\n",
    "- **General LLM:** \"Tell me about the XYZ-3000 chip specifications\" → Generates plausible but entirely fictional specifications\n",
    "- **RAG System:** Retrieves actual XYZ-3000 datasheet → Cites exact voltage ranges, frequencies from real document\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research shows:** RAG reduces hallucinations by **60-80%** in knowledge-intensive tasks.\n",

    "- 📚 **Thousands of documents:** Test specs, datasheets, failure reports, design docs\n",
    "- 🔍 **Hard to search:** Technical jargon, buried in PDFs, inconsistent terminology  \n",
    "- ⏰ **Time-critical:** Engineers need answers during debug sessions (not hours later)\n",
    "- 🔐 **Confidential:** Cannot use public LLMs with proprietary data\n",
    "\n",
    "**RAG solution value:**\n",
    "- ⚡ **Instant answers:** Query \"LPDDR5 timing specs\" → retrieve relevant sections → generate concise answer\n",
    "- 💰 **Cost savings:** Reduce engineer search time from 30min to 30sec (40× faster)\n",
    "- 🎯 **Accuracy:** Ground responses in actual test documents (eliminate guesswork)\n",
    "- 🔒 **Security:** Deploy RAG system on-premises with internal docs\n",
    "\n",
    "**ROI calculation:**\n",
    "- 100 engineers × 2 hours/week searching docs = 200 engineer-hours/week\n",

    "**1. Document Embedding**\n",
    "\n",
    "For document chunk $d_i$, embedding function $f_{embed}$:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**2. Semantic Similarity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cosine similarity between query $q$ and document $d_i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{sim}(q, d_i) = \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_q \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_i}{||\\mathbf{v}_q|| \\cdot ||\\mathbf{v}_i||} = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{d} v_{q,j} \\cdot v_{i,j}}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^{d} v_{q,j}^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^{d} v_{i,j}^2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Top-K Retrieval**\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieve top $k$ most similar documents:\n",
