    "## Part 1: Latency Optimization Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚡ Streaming Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Stream?**\n",
    "- User sees first token in 300ms (vs 3s for full response)\n",
    "- Perceived latency dramatically reduced\n",
    "- Can start acting on partial info\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async def stream_rag_response(query: str):\n",
    "    # Retrieve context (parallel)\n",
    "    docs = await retrieve_async(query)  # 100ms\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Stream LLM response\n",
    "    async for token in llm.stream(query, docs):\n",
    "        yield token  # User sees tokens immediately\n",
    "        \n",
    "    # Total latency: 100ms + first token (200ms) = 300ms perceived\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Aggressive Caching Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Three-Level Cache:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Response Cache (L1 - Fastest)**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Hash(query) → cached response\n",
    "# Hit rate: 30-50% (common queries)\n",
    "# Latency: <10ms\n",
    "response_cache = {\n",
    "    hash(\"How to debug DDR5\"): \"Step 1: Check signal integrity...\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Embedding Cache (L2)**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Hash(query) → embedding vector\n",
    "# Hit rate: 60-70% (query variations)\n",
    "# Latency: <50ms (skip embedding generation)\n",
    "embedding_cache = {\n",
    "    hash(\"How to debug DDR5\"): [0.12, -0.45, ...]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Document Cache (L3)**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Top-K docs for common query patterns\n",
    "# Hit rate: 40-50%\n",
    "# Latency: <100ms (skip vector search)\n",
    "doc_cache = {\n",
    "    \"DDR5_debug\": [doc1, doc2, doc3]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cache Invalidation:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Time-based: 1 hour expiry\n",
    "# Event-based: Document update → invalidate related caches\n",
    "# LRU: Evict least-recently-used when cache full\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 Model Quantization\n",
    "\n",
    "**4-bit Quantization (4× speedup):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, BitsAndBytesConfig\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load 4-bit quantized model\n",
    "quantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(\n",
    "    load_in_4bit=True,\n",
    "    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.float16\n",
    ")\n",

    "model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n",
    "    \"meta-llama/Llama-2-7b\",\n",
    "    quantization_config=quantization_config\n",
