    "\n",
    "**RAG + Fine-Tuning** combines the best of both worlds: retrieval for up-to-date information and fine-tuning for domain expertise. Instead of choosing between RAG or fine-tuning, we do both for optimal results.\n",

    "**RAG vs Fine-Tuning vs Both:**\n",
    "| Approach | Pros | Cons | Best For |\n",
    "|----------|------|------|----------|\n",

    "| **RAG + Fine-Tune** | Domain expertise + up-to-date info + citations | Higher complexity, fine-tuning cost ($10K) | Production systems |\n",

    "- Expensive ($100K-$500K for large models)\n",
    "- Storage: Need to store full model copy for each domain\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**\n",
    "- Fine-tune ONLY small adapter matrices (0.1% of parameters)\n",
    "- Single GPU sufficient (NVIDIA A100)\n",
    "- Affordable ($5K-$10K)\n",
    "- Storage: Base model + small adapters (100MB vs 350GB)\n",
    "\n",
    "**LoRA Math:**\n",
    "- Original weight: W (4096 × 4096 matrix, 16M parameters)\n",
    "- LoRA decomposition: W + ΔW = W + AB\n",
    "  - A: 4096 × 8 (rank-8 adapter)\n",
    "  - B: 8 × 4096\n",
    "  - Total: 65K parameters (0.4% of original)\n",
    "\n",
    "**QLoRA (Quantized LoRA):**\n",
    "- Further optimization: Quantize base model to 4-bit\n",
    "- Enables fine-tuning 65B models on single GPU\n",
    "- Memory: 48GB GPU (vs 320GB for full fine-tuning)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Qualcomm 5G RF Compliance Example\n",
