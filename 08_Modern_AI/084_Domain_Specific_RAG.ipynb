    "\n",
    "**Before Building Domain-Specific RAG:**\n",
    "- [ ] **Domain Analysis**: Identify key terminology (500-5000 terms)\n",
    "- [ ] **Training Data**: Collect 10K+ query-document pairs\n",
    "- [ ] **Fine-Tuning Budget**: $5K-$50K depending on approach\n",
    "- [ ] **Expert Validation**: Domain experts review outputs\n",
    "- [ ] **Specialized Chunking**: Respect document structure\n",
    "- [ ] **Evaluation Dataset**: 1K+ queries with ground truth\n",
    "- [ ] **Baseline Metrics**: Measure generic RAG first (establish baseline)\n",
    "- [ ] **Success Criteria**: Define target metrics (precision, accuracy)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embedding Fine-Tuning:**\n",
    "- Start with OpenAI fine-tuning ($5K, easiest)\n",
    "- If need full control, use Sentence-BERT (more complex, cheaper at scale)\n",
    "- Training data quality > quantity (10K good pairs > 100K noisy)\n",
    "- Validate on held-out set (20% validation split)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Domain Vocabulary:**\n",
    "- TF-IDF for automatic extraction (top 1000 terms)\n",
    "- Named Entity Recognition for technical terms\n",
    "- Expert curation (engineers add missing terms, 500-1000)\n",
    "- Update quarterly (new technologies, new jargon)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost Optimization:**\n",
    "- Fine-tune embeddings ($5K) vs entire LLM ($100K)\n",
    "- Cache embeddings (query embedding reuse)\n",
    "- Use domain LLM only when needed (simple queries → generic LLM)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Insufficient Training Data:**\n",
    "- ❌ Problem: 100 query-document pairs (not enough to learn domain)\n",
    "- ✅ Solution: Collect 10K+ pairs (bootstrap with synthetic queries)\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Ignoring Document Structure:**\n",
    "- ❌ Problem: Fixed 512-token chunks break procedures/tables\n",
    "- ✅ Solution: Semantic chunking (keep procedures intact, respect headers)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. No Expert Validation:**\n",
    "- ❌ Problem: Domain vocabulary incomplete (missing key terms)\n",
    "- ✅ Solution: Engineers review and add terms (500-1000 curated)\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Static System:**\n",
    "- ❌ Problem: Domain evolves (new tech), RAG becomes outdated\n",
    "- ✅ Solution: Quarterly updates (new docs, retrain embeddings, refresh vocabulary)\n",
